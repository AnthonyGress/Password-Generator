## Description

A web app that generates a random secure password with the click of a button. Use any of the toggle switches to make the password stronger or weaker by including more types of characters (numbers, capitals, special characters etc). The password can be up to 128 characters long for maximum security and you can copy the secure password with the click of a button as well.
